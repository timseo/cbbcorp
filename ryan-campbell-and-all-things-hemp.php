                                        <p>With <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nocohempexpo.com/" target="_blank">NoCo</a> just a day away, we thought it’d be a good opportunity to formally announce Ryan Campbell as our Director of Sales and Business Development.</p>
                                        <p>A quick look at Ryan’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryancharlescampbell/" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a> and you’ll see he proudly specializes in “All Things Hemp.” Prior to joining us last year, Ryan served as operations director, sales director and senior account executive for several well-known CBD brands and extractors in Colorado. <br><br>His resume only tells half the story. Sit down with Ryan for a few minutes and you’ll quickly realize his knowledge of the industry surpasses that of many seasoned professionals. </p>
                                        <p>“Hemp production is a trust-based business in an industry where trustworthiness is hard to come by,” says Ryan. “Even though the industry is maturing and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hempindustrydaily.com/fda-science-of-cbd-and-other-cannabinoids-is-a-priority/" target="_blank">FDA regulations</a> are hopefully on the horizon, there are still a lot of pirates out there. CBD companies that want to thrive over the long-haul need reliable hemp partners — companies that have the technology, dedication to quality and safety, and farming knowledge to turn out high-quality isolate on-time, every time.”</p>
                                        <p>Although he’s based in Denver, Ryan regularly travels to Oregon to work with our production and extraction team to make sure products are customized to the unique specifications of every customer.<br><br>“I thrive on providing solutions,” says Ryan. “Our customers come to us with challenges: How do I make this product better? How do I bring our costs down? How can we enter this market or expand into this country? My job is to find solutions that help these companies succeed.”</p>
                                        <p>So what’s next for the All Things Hemp professional? Where does he see the industry going?</p>
                                        <p>“The future of hemp is bright. Once the FDA regulates CBD, we’re going to see an absolute rush of products hitting the marketplace. Our customers are poised and ready, and I can’t wait to watch them grow.”</p>
