                in the future and to protect us from fraud and other losses.
                Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon: (a)

                including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you
                use the Products in breach of these Terms; (iii) if we suspect
                fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity regarding a payment;
                (iv) if we detect, in our sole discretion, that your payments
                have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a
                relatively high risk of losses; or (v) failure to cooperate in
                an investigation or provide additional information when

                relating in any way to your use of or access to the Services

              <p>
                Arbitration. These Terms and each of its parts evidence a
                transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal
                Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the
                interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and
                arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Matters must be asserted
                individually in binding arbitration administered by the
                American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with
                its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA Supplementary
                Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including, without
                limitation, utilizing desk, phone or video conference
                proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs
                of travel). The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class
                or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or
                for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state,
                or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
                resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
                applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms,
                including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part
                of these Terms is void or voidable or a particular claim is
                subject to arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Award. For matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the
                arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
                conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The
                arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in
                accordance with applicable law, including recognized
                principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege
                recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is
                bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same
                Columbia Basin Bioscience user to the extent required by
                applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and
                binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
                may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. THE
                ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE,
                AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
                SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
                RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY
                RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exceptions. There are only two exceptions to this arbitration
                agreement:
              </p>
              <p>
                First, if a party reasonably believes that the other party has
                in any manner infringed or threatened to infringe the
                intellectual property rights of the other party, the party who
                owns the intellectual property rights may seek injunctive or
                other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent
                jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the
                claiming party, be resolved in small claims court within the
                United States, if the claim and the parties are within the
                jurisdiction of the small claims court and so long as the
                matter remains in such court and advances only on an
                individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration,
                and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules,
                unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the
                value of the relief sought is $5,000 or less, at your request,
                Columbia Basin Bioscience will reimburse you for all filing,
                administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the
                arbitration following the earlier of the arbitrator’s decision
                or settlement. In the event the arbitrator determines the
                claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous,
                Columbia Basin Bioscience is relieved of its obligation to
                reimburse you for any fees associated with the arbitration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.
                Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary,
                you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this
                agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not
                apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding
                against Columbia Basin Bioscience prior to the effective date
                of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other
                disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that
                have arisen or may arise between you and Columbia Basin
                Bioscience. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you
                may close your account within thirty (30) days of the posting
                or notification and you will not be bound by the amended
                terms.

                Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes. Unless you and we agree
                otherwise, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above
                is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or
                dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the
                agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the
                arbitrator or a court order or because you have chosen to file
                an eligible lawsuit in small claims court, you agree that any
                claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and
                Columbia Basin Bioscience must be resolved exclusively by a
                state or federal court located in San Francisco, California.
                You and Columbia Basin Bioscience agree to submit to the
                personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San
                Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating all such
                claims or disputes.

              <h3>INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
              <p>
                You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Columbia Basin
                Bioscience and all of our officers, directors, mangers,
                members, employees, agents, information providers, affiliates,
                partners, and licensors (“Columbia Basin Bioscience Party,” or
                collectively, the “Columbia Basin Bioscience Parties”)
                harmless from and against any and all liability, claims,
                damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorneys'
                fees, incurred by any Columbia Basin Bioscience Party arising
                from, related to, or in connection with (a) a violation of any
                provision of these Terms by you; or (b) arising from, related
                to, or connected with your violation of the rights of Columbia
                Basin Bioscience or any other person or entity. We may, in our
                sole and absolute discretion, control the disposition of any
                such claim at your sole cost and expense. You may not settle
                any such claim without our express written consent. This
                defense and indemnification obligation is intended to extend
                to the fullest extent permitted by law and will survive these
                Terms and your use of the Site.

                rights in a separate signed agreement with us, we disclaim to
                the fullest extent permitted by law any service outages that
                are caused by our maintenance on the servers or the technology

                (including telecommunications, hosting, and power providers),

                damage of our facilities, acts of nature, war, civil
                disturbance, or any other cause beyond our reasonable control.
                Under no circumstances shall Columbia Basin Bioscience or its
                licensor or service providers be held liable for any delay or
                failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from
                an event beyond its reasonable control. This provision is not
                intended to disclaim liability that Columbia Basin Bioscience
                may not disclaim under law.

                Survival. If we terminate your right to access the Site, these

                No Waiver; Severability. Our failure to exercise or enforce
                any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a
                waiver of such right or provision, and our failure to exercise
                or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive
                that right or remedy. The provisions of these terms are
                intended to extend to the fullest extent permitted by law. No
                waiver of any term of these Terms will be binding unless in
                writing.
              </p>

                arising out of or related to use of our Site or these Terms
                must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of

              </p>
              <p>
                Applicable Law. These Terms will be construed in accordance
                with the laws of the United States of America and (to the
                extent not inconsistent with or preempted by federal law) the
                State of California, and the parties irrevocably consent to
                bring any action to enforce these Terms before an arbitration
                panel or before a court of competent jurisdiction in San
                Francisco, California if seeking interim or preliminary relief
                or enforcement of an arbitration award.
              </p>
              <p>
                If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or
                unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or
                unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
                the original provision, and the remainder of the Terms shall
                continue in effect.
