                  quickly and easily respond to any questions about your
                  donation. As a result, our collection and processing of your
                  information is based in different contexts upon your consent,
                  our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law,

                    requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately
                    verify your identity. You may revoke consent to processing
                    (where such processing is based upon consent) by contacting

                  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of

                  required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal
                  information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or
                  by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.
