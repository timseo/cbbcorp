                  collecting your information, in many situations we have more
                  than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online

                  contract with you, but we also collect your information
                  because we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your
                  information after your donation is complete so that we can
                  quickly and easily respond to any questions about your
                  donation. As a result, our collection and processing of your
                  information is based in different contexts upon your consent,
                  our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law,
                  and/or our legitimate interest in conducting our business.
